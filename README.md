## About Me

I'm passionate about making AI development accessible through innovative, scalable solutions. Currently leading development of **HyperFlow AI** at **Mirinae Technologies** – a no-code platform that democratizes RAG, agentic, and LLM pipeline creation.

My journey started at **42 School (Paris)**, where I developed deep expertise in systems programming and full-stack development through intensive project-based learning. I've since specialized in AI/ML systems, combining low-level programming knowledge with cutting-edge AI technologies.

### What I Do

- **Build production AI systems**: RAG pipelines, agentic workflows, and LLM integrations
- **Architect scalable solutions**: Designing enterprise-grade AI infrastructure
- **Create developer tools**: No-code platforms that simplify complex AI workflows
- **Optimize LLM applications**: Prompt engineering, model fine-tuning, and performance optimization
